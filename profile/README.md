**Introduction**

Welcome to **Fanbase Labs**, where developers interested in contributing **open source code for creators** can connect with peers, learn, and collaborate! 


**About**

Fanbase Labs releases **free tools** for creators, developers and designers, built on top of **open source**, public protocols, to increase engagement and encourage input from community members. Our user interfaces are taking crypto mainstream with, among other things, an embeddable NFT player used to stream music, swap tickets, or sell game items like skins, and a decentralized swap which allows you to narrow your offer and distribute only one token from your own website.

**Mission**

At Fanbase Labs, we believe that independent artists and developers should be able to gather patrons and distribute their work outside the influence of corporations, VCs, and banking institutions. With that mission in mind, we have created user interfaces and APIs built on top of **open source** protocols and **public blockchains** to facilitate pure independence. 



**Independence**

Pure independence is achieved when creators can swap media and sell tickets from their own website, without middlemen or distributors taking a cut of sales, like Apple Music, or TicketMaster. Today, this freedom is possible using ERC1155s and Fanbase DeFi tools which allow you to swap, 'buy' and 'sell' NFTs from your own website.
  

Pure independence is further acheived when early adopters are rewarded for their engagement and recieve ERC20 tokens that are later redeemable for music, media, or other tokens. Today, this freedom is possible using Fanbase DeFi tools where users earn rewards for jumping on the bandwagon early. 


  
**Tools**

Today, using Fanbase Labs' tools, artists and developers can gather patrons and distribute their work outside the reach of corporations, VCs, and banking institutions. We have created tools, released on public blockchains, that facilitate pure independence. Using **open source** protocols from our partners at Fanbase Foundation, Ethereum Foundation and others, you can now swap ERC1155 NFTs from your own website. This means you can now sell collectible music, motion comics, music videos, general admission tickets, cards, games and films from your own website. And, your collectors can resell that media later.
