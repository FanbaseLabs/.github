**About**

Fanbasse Labs releases **open source** code to increase transparency and encourage input from its community members. 


**Mission**

At Fanbase Labs, we believe that independent artists and developers should be able to gather patrons and distribute their work outside the influence of corporations, VCs, and banking institutions, so we have created DeFi tools and **open source** protocols, released on **public blockchains**, that facilitate pure independence. 


**Tools**

Today, using Fanbase Labs' tools, artists and developers can gather patrons and distribute their work outside the reach of corporations, VCs, and banking institutions. Fanboy has created DeFi tools and open-source protocols, released on public blockchains, that facilitate pure independence. For example, using **open source** widgets, you can now swap ERC1155 NFTs from your own website. This means you can now sell collectible music, motion comics, music videos, general admission tickets, cards, games and films from your own website. 


**Call to Action**

Join Us! If you aree interested in adding value to Fanbase Labs' **open source** repos or connecting with fellow developers building DeFi tools for creators, then you have come to the right place. Here you can make pull requests, open issues, share ideas, help each other, and fix problems!
