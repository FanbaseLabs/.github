**About**

Fanbase Labs releases **free tools** for creators and **open source** code to increase transparency and encourage input from its community members. 


**Mission**

At Fanbase Labs, we believe that independent artists and developers should be able to gather patrons and distribute their work outside the influence of corporations, VCs, and banking institutions. With that mission in mind, we have created user interfaces built on top of **open source** public protocols, released on **public blockchains**, to facilitate pure independence. 


**Independence**

Pure independence is acheived when creators can swap media and sell tickets from their own website, without middlemen or distributors taking a cut of sales, like Apple Music, or TicketMaster. Today, this freedom is possible using ERC1155s and Fanbase DeFi tools which allow you to swap, 'buy' and 'sell' NFTs from your own website.
  

Pure independence is further acheived when early adopters are rewarded for their devotion to a new artist, organization, or technology and recieve ERC20 tokens that can be redeemeed for Ethereum, WFNB, and other large tokens.  Today, this freedom is possible using ERC20s and Fanbasee DeFi tools which allow you to swap tokens from your own website. 

  
**Tools**

Today, using Fanbase Labs' tools, artists and developers can gather patrons and distribute their work outside the reach of corporations, VCs, and banking institutions. Fanboy has created DeFi tools and open-source protocols, released on public blockchains, that facilitate pure independence. Using **open source** widgets, you can now swap ERC1155 NFTs from your own website. This means you can now sell collectible music, motion comics, music videos, general admission tickets, cards, games and films from your own website. 


**Call to Action**

Join Us! If you are interested in adding value to Fanbase Labs' **open source** repos or connecting with developers who are building DeFi tools for creators, then you have come to the right place. Here you can make pull requests, open issues, share ideas, help each other, and fix problems!
